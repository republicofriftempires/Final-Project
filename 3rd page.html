        <div class="p1"><center>
            Since I was in school I loved extra-curricular activities a lot. Because of this, I participated
            in many indoor and outdoor extra-curricular activities such as, cricket,
            badminton, tennis, swimming and also to some indoor extra-curricular activities like
            chess, choir and many more etc.
            <br><br>
            Since I loved these extra-curricular activities a lot I used to go and participate to different events 
            held in and out of school, and I'm really happy to say that I have had wins and loses from each one of those tournaments.

            Since, pre-school our school the Lyceum International School Ratnapura has been offering us 
            with many leadership opportunities this basically includes the class monitor or the library monitor, but after
            grade 5 you will have the chance to become a junior stewardfrom grade six.
            <br><br>
            So, I thought of applying for the leadership programs which are offered by our school and I am proud to say that I have ranked up
            my leaderships from junior steward, junior leader (for 2 years) and finally I beacme the deputy hose captain of our house which was named 
            Cygnus. By these I learnt a lot on how to control a crowd and on how to tolerate wins and loses.
