            Since I was small, I had the passion to become a singer and a musician, so 
            with the influence of my mother (who is presently an Oriental Music Teacher at R/Sumana Balika Vidyalaya, Ratnapura)
            I learnt the fundamentals of music and even got to know how to play the instruments like the 
            guitar, violin, keyboard, piano, recorder and the flute. <br>
            <br>And since I loved music a lot I participated to some english, and sinhala singing competitions held at our
            school premises and I am pround to say that I have become the winner, 1st runner up, 2nd runner up in each and every one of 
            those competitions. Similarly, I have participated for some Inter-Dhamma School Bhakthi-Gee programs held at Avissawella.

        <div class="p22"><center>
            I've had a passionate for drawing since when I was in Grade 5, so what I did was,
            I participated to some of my art competitions held at my father's workplace which
            is held monthly at their office premises, and then by that I got inspired in drawing that 
            I started drawing since grade 5, due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, and since the country was
            in full lockdown, I gradually improved my skills of drawing and day by day I became good at it.
            <br><br>Now, I still use to continue my habbit of drawing at some intervals after a lecture has 
            just finished. Now I'm pround to say that I can draw good, and one of my greatest achievements will be to become an artist someday in my career.
            <br><br>My Drawing skills are based on both physical and digital arts as well.

        <div class="p33"><center>
            My Culinary Skills have developed through time, since when I was 4 years old I had a passion in cooking,
            so with time I learnt new cooking recipies and I learnt on how to make my cooking ideas a reality by making all sorts of new 
            food items that are both very healthy and some which are unhealthy as well. 
            <br><br>Now since I'm really into cooking, I am the one who is supposed to make birthday cakes for my family when their is a 
            birthday or any special occasion.
